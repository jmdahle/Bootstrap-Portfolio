                        I am a father, son and husband.  Not necessarily always in that order, and with varying degrees of success.  I am  financial professional who secretly wants to work with computers instead of retirement models and legal plan documents.  The hardest thing I ever learned is patience.  The best gift from my parents was humility.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        A few factoids about me:
                        <ul class="text-secondary">
                            <li> I used to hate having red hair.  I was always the kid who got caught because I was easily recognized.  Later I liked having red hair because people would remember me more easily and I wouldn't have to embarrasingly re-introduce myself.  Although it's a lot of work, I think I like being bald best, because it doesn't require me to have an opinion about my hair.</li>
                            <li>I graduated high school in a class of nine and a half people.  The half is an exchange student who - after graduating here - had to return to Norway for another year of pre-collegiate education.</li>
                            <li>I lived in Colombia with one of my wife's aunts for 3 months to learn Spanish.  My wife thinks this is so our kids would be raised bilingually and be able to communicate with her extended family in Colombia.  Really it's so I could understand what her family was saying about her gringo husband.</li>
                            <li>My son is a black-belt candidate in Tae Kwon Do.  He got me into the practice some years back.  I think it's so he can boss me around, since he is my senior in the dojang.</li>
                            <li>My favorite type of music is in the extreme metal genres.  A current favorite is Horrendous, a death metal band from Phildelphia.</li>
